A purple soul dash library for the Deltarune Kristal Engine: https://kristal.cc/

When you hold and release z you get a dash that gives you invincibility.
When the soul is blue the dash is on cooldown.
This works on both horizontal and vertical threads.

You must be moving to dash. (Cannot dash will standing still).
You cannot dash between strings.
